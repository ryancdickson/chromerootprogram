# Chrome Root Program

Google Chrome relies on Certification Authority systems ("CAs") to issue certificates to websites. Chrome uses these certificates to help ensure the connections it makes on behalf of its users are properly secured. Chrome accomplishes this by verifying that a website's certificate was issued by a recognized CA, while also performing additional evaluations of the HTTPS connection's security properties. Certificates not issued by a CA recognized by Chrome or a user's local settings can cause users to see warnings and error pages.

When making HTTPS connections, Chrome refers to a list of root certificates from CAs that have demonstrated why continued trust in them is justified. This list is known as a "Root Store." CA certificates included in the [Chrome Root Store](https://g.co/chrome/root-store) are selected on the basis of publicly available and verified information, such as that within the Common CA Database ([CCADB](https://ccadb.org/)), and ongoing reviews by the Chrome Root Program.

In Chrome 105, Chrome began a platform-by-platform transition from relying on the host operating system's Root Store to its own on Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Linux, and Android. This change makes Chrome more secure and promotes consistent user and developer experiences across platforms. Apple policies prevent the Chrome Root Store and corresponding Chrome Certificate Verifier from being used on Chrome for iOS. Learn more about the Chrome Root Store and Chrome Certificate Verifier [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md).

The Chrome Root Program Policy establishes the minimum requirements for self-signed root CA certificates to be included as trusted in a default installation of Chrome. This GitHub repository contains the authoritative version of the Chrome Root Program Policy, previously hosted on chromium.org.

An HTML-rendered version is available [here](https://googlechrome.github.io/chromerootprogram/).
